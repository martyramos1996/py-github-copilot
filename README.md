# Simple Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This extremely simple Python code has been created using GitHub Copilot, via its plugin in JetBrains PyCharm...

I have created this game while going through the "GitHub Copilot Fundamentals: AI Paired Programming" course by Aaron Stewart, available on Pluralsight. This course is part of my company's Gen AI Learning Path.
